Period of work-May 2019 - June 2019

Modeling and Simulation Platform -[DYMOLA](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/dymola/)

DESCRIPTION-

1)Worked on modeling and simulation of Thermal Boilers to analyse the variations in Steam
Generation where the heating element can be searing oil-gas or any other potent material.

2)A modeling and simulation platform called Dymola was used for analyzing the mathematical
results and determining the extent of quality of steam generated.
